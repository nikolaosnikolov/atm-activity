## What is the name of that project?
This project is called ATM machine.
## What does this project do?
This project is a simulation of an ATM machine. It will give you the chance to login in (of course there is no real username and password), and deposit and withdraw money. The machine will not allow you to do some actions such as withdraw money that have a value greater than your total deposits. I made the first version of that project following the instructions of Dr. Williams from the program MIT xPRO Professional Certificate in Coding with MERN. Now, I am presenting to you the latest version of the program that has for basement Dr. Williams' video and my improvements.
## What improvements does this project have?
I have made this project much better in terms of styling which means that I have added a lot of CSS. This project does not use Bootstrap, it is made, however, with React. Furthermore, I added a LogIn form with username and password fields that are not taking content, so if you just click the LogIn button you will get in. This form is just to ensure that in real conditions the user should have logged in firstly. Also, I added red notifications if the person is trying to do actions that are not supported by the system. For instance, if you try to withdraw more money than the total deposits, the system will inform you with this red message below that field of money.
